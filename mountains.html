					<h5><a href="http://mcintyreskiarea.com">McINTRYRE Ski Area</a></h5>
					<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspAwesome ski area for the family! It's fairly cheap and its in Manchester so, its nice and close by. It's not much of a mountain, as far as mountains go, more like a large hill. This fact makes it an awesome beginner mountain! Definitly worth checking it out if you haven't been.</p><br />
					<h5><a href="http://patspeak.com/winter/default.html">PatsPeak</a></h5>
					<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspA great mountain located in Henniker, NH.  It is about a 40 minute drive give or take. The best part about pats peak is that it offers reasonably priced lift tickets and if you are a student or a military personnel you recieve a discount.  It's very family friendly and offers a wonder progressional bunny slope set up. Check out the Link to see the trail map and learn more about the mountain.</p><br />
