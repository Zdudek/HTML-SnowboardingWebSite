				<br /><blockquote> "Living in NH, we know that the winter can be a hard time to enjoy for some.  The excess amounts of cold days and the snow storms that hit hard at times.  It brings about lots of limitations from transportation to gettting outside to exercise and breath some fresh air.  Making the best of this time of year can be accomplished. In my opinion, it can best be done by embracing the snow and heading for the slopes to enjoy it!"</blockquote>

					<h2 align="left"> What is Snowboarding?</h2>
						<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Snowboarding is a winter sport that involves descending down a mountain while the boarder is standing on the board attached to a riderâ€™s feet, using a special kind of boot set onto a mounted binding that straps the boots to the to the board with two horizontal straps.</p> 
					<h2 align="left">History of Snowboarding</h2>
						<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The development of snowboarding was inspired by skateboarding, sledding, surfing and skiing.  It was all started when boys and men would attach plywood or wooden planks from barrels to their feet using clotheslines and horse reins in order to steer themselves down hills. Modern snowboarding began in 1965 when Sherman Poppen, an engineer in Muskegon, Michigan, invented a toy for his daughter by fastening two skies together and attaching a rope to the end so she would have some control as she stood on the board and glided downhill. Dubbed the "Snurfer".
							The person that made the first board that we are familiar with today is Jake Burton Carpenter, a Vermont native who enjoyed snurfing since the age of 14, impressed the crowd at a Michigan snurfing competition with bindings he had designed to secure his feet to the board. In 1977, that same year, he founded Burton Snowboards in Londonderry, Vermont. The "snowboards" were made of wooden planks that were flexible and had water ski foot traps. Burton eventually becoming the biggest name in the business, coming right out of Vermont!</p>
